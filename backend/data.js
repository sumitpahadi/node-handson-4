        "description": "Top Gun Maverick box office day 1 collection: Tom Cruise's film collected $51 million at the US box office on its opening day. In India, it collected ₹4.75 crore. Top Gun came out in 1986, establishing Cruise, then 24, as an action hero. He’s nearly 60 now, promoted to US Navy captain in the sequel, and working hard to recreate the magic from 36 years ago.Director Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun Maverick, which features Tom Cruise, had a contrasting opening at the box office in India and the US. In the US, the film collected $51 million on its opening day. The film is already Tom’s best opening day ever beating Mission Impossible – Fallout's first-day collection. However, the film has not been able to make a mark in India and collected ₹4.75 crore on day one. In Top Gun Maverick, Tom essays the role of Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, who is grappling with the diminished standing of fighter pilots in a world that now wages war with drones controlled by people miles away on computers. Top Gun Maverick is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie and David Ellison.As per a Deadline report, Top Gun Maverick at this Friday night hour is on its way to a $51 million opening day (which includes $19.3 million previews). It would not be shocking to wake up on Saturday morning and see that the sequel has edged out Iron Man 2 ($51.2M) to become Paramount’s top opening day ever. Already, the sequel is Tom Cruise’s best opening day ever in US/Canada besting Mission: Impossible – Fallout‘s first day of $22.8M by 124%."

        "description": "As I was waiting for someone at a Delhi hotel recently, I saw a gentleman coming my way. He sat next to me and curiously asked about the laptop I was using. “It’s a Surface Laptop Studio,” I replied. “Does Microsoft make its own laptops?” He admitted he wasn’t aware of the Surface brand but told me he liked the form factor of the Surface Laptop Studio. “It’s different from my MacBook Pro,” said the man who introduced himself as the owner of an architectural firm. This conversation just reinforced my belief that there will be takers for Microsoft’s experimental Surface Laptop Studio, which blends certain elements of the desktop Surface Studio and the premium 2-in-1 Surface Book. It’s a mobile workstation that’s also a sketching slate and a portable home theater. I have been using the Surface Laptop Studio for a few days, and I am in love with this device even though it is not perfect. Here is my review."

It helps in numerous ways, be it in improving flexibility, strength and posture, or reducing stress and providing a sense of calm. Nutrition and diet are an important part of fitness along with physical exercise. On that account, it becomes necessary to understand whether yoga should be done on an empty stomach or notAnshuka Parwani, a yoga expert, and Pooja Makhija, a nutritionist took to Instagram to talk about this dilemma that many face.Pooja believes that it’s important to have something before starting with your exercise in the morning. It should be quite light and not too heavy to kickstart your metabolism.While both have contrasting opinions, they strongly agreed and upheld the point that you know your body better than anyone else. Hence, it’s important to observe and understand what your body is trying to tell you and do as one may deem fit. They said, if practising yoga on an empty stomach is suiting you better, do that. On the other hand, if it feels like you need something to get a better start, follow that as a part of your routine.    "

        "description": "The story of the Milky Way begins nearly 13.6 billion years ago, shortly after the Big Bang. Over the eons, gravity played a pivotal role in shaping the galaxy's structure. Explore how gas and dust clouds collapsed, triggering star formation, and leading to the birth of stellar nurseries, where new stars continue to emerge. At first glance, the Milky Way appears as a streak of light across the night sky. However, it is far more intricate. Discover the different components that make up the galaxy, including the bulge, the spiral arms, and the enigmatic dark matter halo. We'll delve into the supermassive black hole at its center, believed to be 4 million times the mass of our Sun.The spiral arms of the Milky Way are one of its most striking features. Learn about the density waves that shape these arms and the star clusters nestled within them. These clusters serve as natural laboratories for studying stellar evolution and provide insights into the galaxy's history. Scientists have been intrigued by the concept of the 'Galactic Habitable Zone,' which refers to the region within the galaxy where life-supporting conditions are most likely to exist. Examine the factors that contribute to this zone and what it means for our understanding of life in the universe."
